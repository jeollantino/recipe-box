### OBJECTIVE: 

To create a master-detail application that provides information to users on random recipes and procedures to follow. This application should display a list of items obtained from a iTunes Search API and show a detailed view of each item.

### REQUIREMENTS:

#### General:

The Recipe Box Android App project utilizes the following libraries that demonstrates the app's functionality:
- Retrofit
- Glide
- MVVM
- Concurrency (Coroutine)

The app's recipe list page consists of the following details from the API: 
- Recipe Name
- Icon 
- Details
- Tags

The app's recipe detail page displays a long description and other specific information for the selected recipe.

#### Persistence:

The app demonstrates the ability to save data such as:
- Enabling users to add recipes to Saved Recipes and preview them offline whenever needed.

#### Architecture:

For this project, I have implemented an MVVM design pattern and put it into good practice. Adding everything in a single activity or page would lead to problems in testing and maintaining the code as the project grows in the future. Hence, the use of separation of UI and business logic is recommended even for this small project. 

#### Documentation:

The project provides a simple internal documentation to explain each functionality and flow of the app.



### UI AND DESIGN:

The app's theme and feel is somehow based on the stardard material design guidelines for Android mobile applications. I have chosen a light themed background with little contrasting flat-colored accent of elements to make the contents stand out. The screens and UI inside uses a content-rich visual consistency approach that is attractive, straightforward, and at the same time effective on the user experience.
